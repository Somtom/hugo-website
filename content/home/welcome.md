# About this blog
Hello and welcome to my first data analysis blog!   
In order to further improve my skills in these fields I decided to start a blog where I could post
some of my analysis to get feedback from the community. Since I really appreciate the freely 
available resources online, I also wanted to give something back. That's why I am planning to 
post resources which helped me on my continuing path to becoming a data analyst or to provide 
some small tutorials for things I recently learned.   

You'll find my work in the *Post* section. Feel free to contact me for questions or feedback.
