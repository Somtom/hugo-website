# Biography

After growing up on a small farm near Nürnberg in Germany I studied Agricultural Science and 
Agricultural Management with a focus on animal behavior. If you had asked me about data analysis 
and coding at this time, I would not have been able to tell you very much about these topics.
My Journey into the world of data science, machine learning and coding began with my Master Thesis
where I started to develop a early disease identification model for calves on automatic feeders
together with the [Förster Technik GmbH](http://www.foerster-technik.de).  

I started to learn R and Python from the scratch and have been diving deeper into the fields of
machine learning and data analysis since then. I have never experienced such a infinite motivation to 
learn something new before. Currently I am continuing on my self taught path to becoming a Data Analyst.
